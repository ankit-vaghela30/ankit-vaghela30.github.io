# Cilia Segmentation

This repository contains several algorithms for cilia segmentation and other support scripts for further experiments. Although Cilia segmentation is 3 label segmentation, we modify the mask to contain only cilia and background. We used three different approaches to solve the problen:

1) Optical Flow
2) Unet
3) Tiramisu

# Data

Data are sequences of frame images. There are 325 videos in total each with 100 consecutive frames of a grayscale video of cilia. 211 of them are for training and 114 for testing.

Each training video also has one mask image with 3 labels. Background pixels are labeled 0, cells are labeled 1 and cilia are labeled as 2.

The output is one mask for each testing video with pixels of cilia being labeled as 2.

# Getting Started

Below are instructions for installing and using this package.

## Prerequisites

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
- [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)
- [Keras](https://keras.io/#installation)
- [openCV](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/opencv-python)

## Environment Setup

You can use the `REQUIREMENTS.txt` file to setup the environment. The routine is as below:

```
conda create --name MY_ENV --file REQUIREMENTS.txt
source activate MY_ENV
```
# Execution Step
```
python3 -m hastings.__main__ <args>
```
The following arguments are supported by our model:
- **model** : Specify the model you want to use.
                  Ex: --model="unet"
- **mode** : Specify if you want to fit the model or predict.
                  Ex: --mode="fit"
- **operation** : Specify if you want to preprocess
                  Ex: --operation="preprocess"
- **image_path** : Specify the path of  numpy array of prepared image data
                  Ex: --image_path="/home/ubuntu/img.npy"
 - **mask_path** : Specify the path of numpy array of prepared mask data
                  Ex: --mask_path="/home/ubuntu/mask.npy"
 - **model_path**: Specify the path of trained model
                  Ex: --model_path="/home/ubuntu/model.h5"
 - **save_path**: Specify the path where you want to save result (Model while fitting, predictions while predicting, numpy arrays while predicting. The path is only required till the directory.
                  Ex: --save_path="/home/ubuntu/models/"
 - **file_path** : Specify the path to the train.txt or test.txt files which contain the hash values of folders/
                  Ex: --file_path="/home/ubuntu/data/train.txt"
 - **data_path** : Specify the path to the data folder which contains each hash folder.
                  Ex: --data_path="/home/ubuntu/data/train/"
 - **num_images**: Specify the number of images to consider for training or testing from each hash folder.
                  Ex: --numImages=16
    
## Run the testing

- Testing all modules
```
./setup.py test
```
- Testing one module
```
python -m pytest tests/[file you want to test]
```
- Testing one function under one module
```
python -m pytest tests/[file you want to test]::[function name]
```

# Evaluation

Evaluation of the output masks is done by checking IoU. An illustration for calculating IoU is show asa below.

## Test results

Algorithm | Parameter value | IoU |
----------|-----------------|-----|
Optical Flow | threshold = 110 |16.02|
Optical Flow | threshold = 100 |17.73|
Optical Flow | threshold = 90  |18.97|
Optical Flow | threshold = 85  |19.34|
Optical Flow | threshold = 81  |19.48142|
Optical Flow | threshold = 80  |19.48875|
Optical Flow | threshold = 79  |19.48135|
Optical Flow | threshold = 78  |19.47|
Optical Flow | threshold = 75  |19.40|
Optical Flow | threshold = 70  |19.00|

# Accuracy Score
The score below is based on the Autolab grader used by Dr.Shannon Quinn for the course.
- **optical Flow** : 19.48875
- **Unet** : 4.6
- **Tiramisu** : Couldn't train or test on the whole dataset.
