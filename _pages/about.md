I am a Machine learning and Deep learning enthusiast, a grad student with passion for Data Science.

I have 1.5 years of academic hands-on Data science experience which includes applying Machine learning and Deep learning algorithms to huge volume of data and visualising the data for better decision making. I have worked with diverse datasets like time-series image dataset, byte format malware data, natural language document corpus etc. I have 4+ years of experience as a Software developer working on technologies like Java, Python, Node.js, hadoop, hive, HBase etc. 

I love to participate in Hackathons. Last year, I won third place at MLH Hackathon organised at Georgia State university.[check this link](http://www.cs.uga.edu/news/stories/2018/cs-students-win-3rd-place-gsu-hackathon)

I have a knack for learning new technologies and my goal is to combine my Machine learning and Software engineering skills to create products that matter.

I am currently looking for full-time job starting from July, 2019.
