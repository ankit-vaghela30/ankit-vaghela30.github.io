I am a Machine learning and Deep learning enthusiast, a grad student with passion for Data Science.

I have 1.5 years of academic hands-on Data science experience which includes applying Machine learning and Deep learning algorithms to huge volume of data and visualising the data for better decision making. I have worked with diverse datasets like time-series image dataset, byte format malware data, natural language document corpus etc. I have 4+ years of experience as a Software developer working on technologies like Java, Python, Node.js, hadoop, hive, HBase etc. I am currently working as a Research Assistant at UGA creating a web platform for biology students to simulate genetic experiments. 

I love to participate in Hackathons. Last year, I won third place at MLH Hackathon organised at Georgia State university. 

I continuously learn new technologies. My current skillset is as below:

* Programming Languages: Python, Java, Javascript, Node.JS, HTML, CSS

* Big Data Technologies: Apache Spark, Hadoop, Hive, Pig

* Machine Learning Skills: 
** Classification - Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees Clustering - K-Means
** Regression - Linear Regression 
** Deep Learning - CNN, UNET, Tiramisu, VGG16

* Data Visualization/Reporting: matplotlib, HBase, Excel

* Data Extraction: SQL, Beautiful-soup for web crawling

* Data Science/Machine Learning Libraries: Tensorflow, Keras, NumPy, Scikit learn, Pandas, NLTK

* Cloud Services: Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services

I have a knack for learning new technologies and my goal is to combine my Machine learning and Software engineering skills. I am looking for full-time opportunities starting from July, 2019.
