Machine learning and Deep learning enthusiast. A grad student with passion for Data Science.

I have 1.5 years of academic hands-on Data science experience which includes applying Machine learning and Deep learning algorithms to huge volume of data and visualising the data for better decision making. I have worked with diverse datasets like time-series image dataset, byte format malware data, natural language document corpus etc. I have 4+ years of experience as a Software developer working on technologies like Java, hadoop, hive, HBase etc. I am currently working as a Research Assistant at UGA creating a web platform for biology students to simulate genetic experiments. 

I love to participate in Hackathons. Last year, I won third place at MLH Hackathon organised at Georgia State university. 

I continuously learn new technologies. My current skillset is as below:
Programming Languages: Python, Java, Javascript, Node.JS, HTML, CSS

Big Data Technologies: Apache Spark, Hadoop, Hive, Pig

Machine Learning Skills: Classification - Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees | Clustering - K-Means| Regression - Linear Regression | Deep Learning - CNN, UNET, Tiramisu, VGG16

Data Visualization/Reporting: matplotlib, HBase, Excel

Data Extraction: SQL, Beautiful-soup for web crawling

Data Science/Machine Learning Libraries: Tensorflow, Keras, NumPy, Scikit learn, Pandas, NLTK

Cloud Services: Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services

I have a knack for learning new technologies. My interest lies in Data science and AI and I am looking for full-time opportunities in the same field.
